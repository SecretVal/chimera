# STC
STC is my shot at implementing a standard c library. Of course there is libc but that isn't enough for me.
STC includes a lot of utils (like macros for shifting arrays, etc,...) and overall things the "normal" c dev will need in almost every project.

## Building
In the future i want STC to also handle building my projects kinda like [nob](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h) from rexim.
